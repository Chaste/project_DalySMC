= Two Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Exact and Approximate Bayesian Inference on Cardiac Models =

This tutorial describes how to download and execute the Sequential Monte Carlo code
for inference on the linear, polynomial, and Hodgkin-Huxley models as described in "Two Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers for Exact and Approximate Bayesian Inference on Cardiac Models",
submitted to ''PLoS Comput Biol'' in 2017.

== Installation ==

This project requires the Functional Curation add-on to Chaste in order to run, which in turn requires the Chaste source tree to be installed.
Instructions for this installation can be found for a variety of operating systems under InstallGuides/.

Extra install commands needed as well as the Ubuntu chaste-dependencies package are (on 14.04 at least):
{{{
#!sh
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-scipy python-numpy cython python-tables python-matplotlib python-numexpr python-pip
sudo apt-get install scons
sudo -H pip install dill pathos
}}}

Afterwards, obtain the latest version of all the code from the Chaste repositories using:
{{{
#!sh
git clone -b develop https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/git/chaste.git Chaste
cd Chaste/projects

# Use your email address as the password for the 'anonymous' account.
svn co https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/FunctionalCuration --username anonymous --password my.email@domain.com
svn co https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/DalySMC --username anonymous --password my.email@domain.com
}}}

== Usage ==

This needs updating :)

Source code for the ABC-SMC parameter fitting algorithm is contained in the `src` folder.
Python scripts for performing inference on both the simplified and full Hodgkin-Huxley
model can be found in `tests`.
Source code for the SMC parameter fitting algorithms is contained in the `src` folder.
Python scripts for performing inference on all model problems can be found in `tests`. 
All functional curation protocol files can be found in `tests/protocols`, while the
annotated CellML model file can be found in the top-level project directory as
`hodgkin_huxley.cellml`.

A description of important files and their contents follows below:
 * `src/fitting.py` contains the implementation of ABC-SMC with adaptive error shrinking.
 * `src/HodgkinHuxley.py` contains accessors for voltage clamp experimental data digitized
 from the original 1952 publication. Used for all fitting experiments.
 * `tests/HodgkinHuxleyFittingABC_simple.py` contains the python script for performing
 inference on the simplified models of potassium (2 parameters) and sodium (4 parameters)
 conductance.
 * `tests/HodgkinHuxleyFittingABC.py` contains the python script for performing
 inference on the full models of potassium (5 parameters) and sodium (9 parameters) conductance.
 * `tests/ProbabalisticAP` generates graphs of differential response of models parameterized
 according to a sample ABC posterior estimate of sodium/potassium conductance when subjected
 to more complex voltage protocols.

To generate ABC posterior estimates for the six-parameter simplified Hodgkin-Huxley model
as described in the paper, use:
{{{
scons projects/HodgkinHuxleyABC/test/HodgkinHuxleyFittingABC_simple.py
}}}
To generate ABC posterior estimates for the 14-parameter full Hodgkin-Huxley model
as described in the paper, use:
{{{
scons projects/HodgkinHuxleyABC/test/HodgkinHuxleyFittingABC.py
}}}
To see verbose output on the progress of the ABC algorithm, add the flag `no_store_results=1` to the `scons` commands above.
Note however that this will prevent storing a copy of the output on disk.
